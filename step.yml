  Firebase Crashlytics dSYM Upload
summary: |
  Upload dSYM to Google Firebase via Fabric Crashlytics
description: |
  This step is for apps that are using Google Firebase and Google Crashlytics by Fabric.\nThis step should be run after the xcode-archive step. It uses a script from your installed Fabric pod to upload the dSYM files generated from the xcode-archive step to Google Firebase (this is normally done automatically during the build phase but fails when your build settings have Enable Bitcode set to true).\nYou will need to have configured Google Firebase for your project and have a GoogleService.-Info.plist file in your project, as well as having the Fabric pod installed for this step to work. Please see https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup and https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-started

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:
